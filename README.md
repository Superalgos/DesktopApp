## Introduction

Superalgos is not just another open-source project. We are an open and welcoming community devised, nurtured, and incentivized with the project's native [Superalgos (SA) Token](https://superalgos.org/token-overview.shtml) to build an [open trading intelligence network](https://superalgos.org/).

You will notice the difference as soon as you join the [Telegram Community Group](https://t.me/superalgoscommunity) or the new [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/CGeKC6WQQb)!

> Can't wait to contribute? Start by giving a star to this repository in the top-right corner of this page!

![superalgos-readme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13994516/106380124-844d8980-63b0-11eb-9bd9-4f977b6c183b.gif)

## Getting Started Guide

All procedures are the same for Windows, Linux, or Mac OS. Raspberry Pi terminal commands have been included for ease of use.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> 
> Remote installations and minimalist hardware — both virtual and physical — are better suited for production deployments, where the use of the GUI is minimal. We highly recommend learning Superalgos in a local installation. Mastering the system takes time, and the use of the GUI to go through in-app tutorials is crucial during the learning process. Your experience will be orders of magnitude better if you follow this advice: leave remote installations and minimalist hardware for when you are ready to start trading live.

## Pre-Requisites

In order to run Superalgos on your computer, you will need the latest versions of Node JS and Git installed. You will also need a web browser to access the interface. Google Chrome is recommended as it is what the development team uses and supports.

- [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Git download page](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Google Chrome download page](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

### Windows Install

You can use the windows installer (Setup file) which will install all the necessary dependencies and files for you to run the platform. Also the shortcuts are placed. This application will notify you and update as new releases come (to be released).

 **IMPORTANT:**
 The single executable and the installer do not have Tensorflow active yet.

> **NOTE**
> There's a known issue where the screen stays white. In this case, go to "View/Reload" and it should work. 

The manual installation option, tailored for users who are experienced and who want to contribute to the project (highly appreciated and rewarded with SA tokens). Follow the install wizards to install the latest NodeJS and Github Desktop applications.

- [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Select "Current" then "Windows Installer", then follow the wizard to install after the download completes.
- [GitHub Desktop downloat page](https://desktop.github.com/). Click the "Download for Windows" button and follow the wizard to install after the download completes.
- [Google Chrome download page](https://www.google.com/chrome/). After the install, it is recommended to set Chrome as the default browser.
- If you intend on running the machine learning features (TensorFlow), you must [install Python 2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/) as well.

### Mac OS Install

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) can be used to install the requirements with minimal effort on Mac OS.  After you clone the repository, change directory to the Superalgos base and install the requirements using the Brewfile. Python 3 is only required for running machine learning (TensorFlow).

```sh
brew install git node npm python@3.9
```

Or use the `Brewfile` included in the code repository. After downloading, run this command in the same directory where the `Brewfile` resides:

```sh
brew bundle
```

You can use Safari or Google Chrome as your default browser. If you run into a bug in Safari, you will be asked to reproduce it in Chrome as the development team uses Chrome.

### Linux Install (e.g. Raspberry Pi running Raspberry Pi OS/Raspbian)

[Follow the Node.js package manager install instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) for your distribution to ensure you are getting the latest version of Node.js. Many distributions only maintain an older version in their default repositories. Python 3 is only required for running machine learning (TensorFlow).

```sh
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs npm git python3
```

You may verify the installed versions with these commands:

```sh
node -v
npm -v
git --version
```

If you are running headless (i.e. as a server without a monitor attached) then you do not need to install a web browser and you can follow the tutorial for information on connecting remotely to the server.

## Superalgos Platform Client Installation

### Fork the Superalgos Repository

- Scroll the page all the way to the top. Find and click the **Fork** button to create your fork/copy of this repository. To fork Superalgos you need a Github account. If you don't have one, go ahead and create it.

> **NOTE**
> 
> A Fork is required for your contributions to the project. The reason why Superalgos is free and open-source is that the project has set up a [collective business](https://superalgos.org) in which all users may participate. The way to participate is to [contribute](https://superalgos.org/community-contribute.shtml) to make Superalgos better. The project's [token](https://superalgos.org/token-overview.shtml) is distributed among contributors.

### Clone Your Fork

- Once the fork is created, you will land on the page of your fork. Copy the URL from your browser's address bar.
- In your computer/laptop/server, open a command prompt or terminal. Make sure you are in a directory where you have write permissions (on most systems the terminal will open in your user's home directory, so you're good). Clone the git repository using the command:

```sh
git clone <URL of your Superalgos fork>
```

For example, if your Github username is John, the command will look like this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/John/Superalgos
```

This creates the `Superalgos` folder in the current directory, which contains the whole installation.

### Install Node Dependencies

After the Superalgos directory has been installed, the final step of installation is to set up the necessary node dependencies. In the same command prompt or terminal you just used, type the following:

```sh
cd Superalgos
```

That should take you inside the Superalgos folder created by the `git clone` command earlier. Now type `node setup` to install the dependencies.

```sh
node setup
```

By default, desktop shortcuts are created if they can be. Currently, Mac OS shortcuts are not created. Linux installations may require extra steps to view and use the shortcuts.

Available Options:

```sh
usage: node setup <options>
```

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `noShortcuts` | Do not install desktop shortcuts |
| `tensorflow` | Include the TensorFlow dependencies |

> **NOTE FOR WINDOWS USERS INSTALLING TENSORFLOW DEPENDENCIES:**
> 
> You may get an error at the end of the set up process. If you do, please follow the instructions following the error message.

> **NOTE FOR USERS INSTALLING MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF SUPERALGOS ON THE SAME MACHINE:**
> 
> In order to avoid name conflicts between shortcuts, make sure to rename each Superalgos directory before running `node setup`.

Congratulations your installation is complete! Follow the "Running the Application" directions below.

#### Troubleshooting Dependency Installation

If you are having difficulty running the node setup command here are a few common issues that may be getting in the way.

1. Check the version of node and npm you have installed. Make sure that you are running an updated version of node greater than version 12 and npm greater than version 5. You can check which version you have by typing `node -v` and `npm -v` into a command prompt or terminal. If your version numbers are below these, you can update your installation by following the instructions outlined in the "Node JS Installation" step above.
2. If you are installing Superalgos in an administratively protected directory you will need to do one of the following:
   - For Windows start your command prompt as an administrator.
   - For Linux and Mac Systems make sure to add the sudo command to node setup.  This will look like `sudo node setup`.
3. For Windows it is important that you have C:\Windows\System32 added to your global PATH.  For instructions on how to do this google "add to the path on Windows 10."

#### Enable Desktop Shortcut in Ubuntu

The majority of shortcuts that are automatically installed will work out of the box. Desktop shortcuts on Ubuntu, however, require a few additional steps to set up. First, desktop icons need to be enabled within the Tweaks app.

- Check if Tweaks is installed.
- If not go to Ubuntu Software.
- Install Tweaks.
- Open Tweaks.
- Under extensions turn on Desktop Icons

![enable-ubuntu-shortcut](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55707292/117553927-f0780300-b019-11eb-9e36-46b509653283.gif)

> **TIP:** If you do not see the desktop shortcut appear right away you may need to restart your computer.

Finally, you will need to enable the desktop shortcut. Right click Superalgos.desktop and select Allow Launching.

![allow-launching](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55707292/117553933-fcfc5b80-b019-11eb-872c-4fad81b184d2.gif)

Now both launcher and desktop shortcuts will launch Superalgos like any other program on your computer.

### Installation Notes

- You need to make a fork so that you may contribute work. Superalgos is a Community project and you are expected to contribute, like everyone else. You don't need to be a technical person to contribute. Fixing a typo in the docs or translating a paragraph into your native language are valuable contributions too. Superalgos has built-in features that make contributing easy. Help make Superalgos better and Superalgos will better serve you! Free-riding is not cool, particularly on free, open-source, Community-driven projects.
- The software includes an in-app self-update command / feature. It will help you stay up-to-date with the latest version of the software. Updates are on-demand, so don't worry about undesired updates. The project moves very fast and new features become available regularly, particularly if you choose to run the software in the `develop` branch (you may switch branches from within the app).
- It is a good idea to perodically run the `node setup` command to keep the underlying dependencies for your Superalgos installation up to date.
- Before installing the client on a remote computer in an attempt to access the UI from a different machine, we highly recommend you do a standard installation on your PC / laptop first. Leave your Raspberry Pi or VPS for later, once you have done all available tutorials. This single tip will save you a lot of time: you don't need to add complexity before you learn how to handle the app, and the GUI performs best in a local installation.

### Uninstall

Superalgos writes nothing outside of the `Superalgos` folder other than shortcut files. In order to quickly remove the shortcut files, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to your main Superalgos directory, and type the following command:

```sh
node uninstall
```

Then simply delete the `Superalgos` folder to completely remove the application.

## Usage

### Run the Client and GUI

#### Using the shortcuts

If you ran `node setup` with no options above, then you should see a desktop icon which you can double click to launch the Superalgos application. A terminal window will show the server is running, and a browser window will open with the WebUI.

#### Using the Command Line

To run Superalgos, go to the Superalgos directory/folder and run this command:

```sh
node platform
```

Available Options:

```sh
usage: node platform <options>
```

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `minMemo` | Run with minimal memory footprint. This is critical for running on platforms with less than 8GB of ram, like a Raspberry Pi. |
| `noBrowser` | Do not attempt to open the WebUI in a browser. This is useful on headless servers where a UI is not available. |

The Client will run on your terminal and the GUI will launch on your default browser. If Chrome/Safari is not your default browser, copy the URL, close the browser, open Chrome/Safari, and paste the URL. Be patient... it takes a few seconds to fully load the GUI.

A Welcome Tutorial pops-up automatically. You must do this Tutorial to finish the setup and to learn the basics. It's the ultimate onboarding experience, superior to all other resources available, including videos and the Docs.

![run-the-system-01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13994516/107037804-e5fc6200-67bb-11eb-82f2-d0f40247fa14.gif)

### Usage Notes

We are testing the UI on Google Chrome and Safari on macOS only. It may work on other browsers as well &mdash; or not. If you are running on a different browser and ever need support, make sure you mention that fact upfront, or even better, try on Chrome/Safari first.

> **TIP:**
> 
> If your computer has 8 GB of RAM or less, use `node platform minMemo` to run the system with minimal RAM requirements.

### Running Superalgos on a Headless Linux Server as a Daemon

If you're running Superalgos on a headless linux server like a Raspberry Pi, you might want to run it as a daemon so it isn't attached to your current login session. The easiest, most standard way to go about this is probably using `systemd`. Most linux distributions use it as default init system/service manager.

#### Using Systemd

Create a `superalgos.service` file looking like this (change `<user>` to your user name and `/path/to/Superalgos` to your Superalgos folder, for instance `/home/John/Superalgos`):

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Superalgos Platform Client

[Service]
Type=simple
User=<user>
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/Superalgos
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node platform minMemo noBrowser

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

There is no need to run Superalgos as root so we're running it as a user. The `minMemo` option assumes you're running on a small machine like a Raspberry Pi, while `noBrowser` makes sense for running daemonized. Now, you'll need to move the file to `/etc/systemd/system/` in order for it to be recognized. You'll need then to enable and start the service.

```sh
sudo mv superalgos.service /etc/systemd/system
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable superalgos
sudo systemctl start superalgos
```

To see the output of Superalgos, use:

```sh
journalctl -u superalgos
```

or to follow the output with `-f`:

```sh
journalctl -u superalgos -f
```

### Docker Deployments

See the [Docker Readme for more information](Docker/README.md).

## Welcome Tutorial

Once the app finishes loading, an interactive tutorial takes you by the hand and walks you all around the system while you learn the basic skills required to use the interface, mine data, backtest strategies, and even run a live trading session. It is highly recommended you follow the tutorial until the end, as it is carefully crafted to make your onboarding as easy as possible. Tutorials are the absolute best way to tackle the learning curve. You should do all tutorials before you start exploring other avenues on your own.

![welcome-tutorial-00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13994516/107038771-4a6bf100-67bd-11eb-92e0-353525a972a9.gif)

> **NOTE:**
> 
> The tutorial uses Binance or Binance US as the exchange of choice. If you don't have an account with Binance or Binance US, you will still be able to follow 100% of the tutorial. When you get to the live trading section, keep going even if you don't intend to run the session. You may learn how to work with other exchanges later on.
