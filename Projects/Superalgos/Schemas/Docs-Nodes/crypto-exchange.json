In such a case, finding the right set of parameters to work with a specific exchange may be challenging, nd involves understanding how the exchanges API and the CCXT Library API work. In other words, there is no hard rule as of what each of the values should be. Determining each of this values requires exploring the exchange's API documentation, as well as the documentation of the CCXT Library."
