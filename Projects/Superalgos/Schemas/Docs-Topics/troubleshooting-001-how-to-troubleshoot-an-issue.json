The more you understand, the less time and effort you will waste with issues related to a lack of understanding, and the more focused your questions will be when asking for help. You may be inclined to take a shortcut and ask the community before doing your research. This may save you some time occasionally and may be appropriate in cases in which you need a little guidance or need to clear a quick doubt, particularly if you are a beginner and are still following the Getting Started Guide. However, the problem with lack of understanding is that it is a persistent condition until you deal with the root cause. The way to deal with the root cause is taking the time to read the documentation. Otherwise, you will find yourself dealing with the same constraints over and over again. Acquiring knowledge while being mindful of the Team’s time is the first step towards becoming a valuable member of the community.",
