# What you can do with this report program

You can take the output from Binance Order History Exports and produce day by day summary reports and trade by trade detailed reports.

Binary releases (inc. Windows 10 executable and .DLLs) for this report can be found here:

Usage instructions for this program can be found in the README at the above link.

It's written in C++ and has been developed with Visual Studio. I used a cmake project so it should compile under Linux as well as Windows.

I've created it out of my own needs/wants but I can see it morphing into the Superalgos Social Trading App as a report.
